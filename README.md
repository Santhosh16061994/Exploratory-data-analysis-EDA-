# Exploratory-data-analysis-EDA-


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process of inspecting a dataset to summarize its main characteristics, 
often with visual methods. It helps you find patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses. EDA is an important part of any data science project, 
as it helps you understand the data before you start building models.





### Here are some of the benefits of EDA:


It can help you identify errors in the data.
It can help you understand the distribution of the data.
It can help you identify relationships between different variables.
It can help you identify outliers.
It can help you generate hypotheses about the data.
